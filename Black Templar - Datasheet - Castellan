### **4. Fähigkeiten (Abilities)**

* **Leader:** This model can be attached to the following units: Assault Intercessor Squad, Infernus Squad, Intercessor Squad, Crusader Squad, Sword Brethren, Sternguard Veteran Squad.
* **Second Leader:** You can attach this model to one of the above units even if one **Captain** or **Chapter Master** model has already been attached to it. If you do, and that **Bodyguard** unit is destroyed, the Leader units attached to it become separate units, with their original Starting Strengths.
* **Vehement Aggression:** While this model is leading a unit, each time that unit is selected to fight, take a Leadership test for that unit: if passed, until the end of the phase, each time a model in that unit makes an attack, you can re-roll the Hit roll; if failed, until the end of the phase, each time a model in that unit makes an attack, re-roll a Hit roll of 1.
* **Prioritised Eradication:** Each time a model in this model's unit makes a melee attack that destroys one or more enemy units, roll one D6: on a 4+, you gain 1 CP.
